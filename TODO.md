Buffers have premultiplied alpha, and currently gaussianBlur ignores the fact.

Layers
------

Create an OpenGL based canvas that has multiple layers that are created on different textures. This has the following advantages:

* Layers can be updated seperately
* Layers can have z-values, so that they can be drawn on different levels in 3D space. 
* Layers can have real time effects such as glow, drop shadow and blur
